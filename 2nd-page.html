  <p class="content"> Planting is easy, however, it is still important that you pick the right place and right soil for yout plants.
      For instance, many of you are living in a house/ apartment that don't get much of the sunshine, you should plant vegetables that
      can grow in the shade.
  <p class="content"> With that said, most vegetables and fruits we encounter need at least 6 hours of sunlight everyday.
      Picking soil is as important as picking the right spot. Different vegetables love different level of acidity of the soil.
      Downbelow, you have two links to learn more about your vegetables before you plant/transplant them.</P>
